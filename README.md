### FileIndexer
Basic FileIndexer in both c++ and haskell

## What is This ?!
This is a basic file indexer,
This program searches all words in specific files
returns most and least occured 10 words and the file index that was found in

**Only** works on files that has number for name (file extension must be .txt)
File names should be consecutive

# Example:
> ./haskellImp 5
this will search and index files:
> 1.txt
> 2.txt
> 3.txt
> 4.txt
> 5.txt
and will throw error if for example 3.txt was not found
I was lazy to pass them arguments :(
